We use the h-bridge to allow us to switch between going forward and backward on the motor. Activating input 1 makes it go forward and activating input 2 makes it go backwards. Its speed is decided by the amount of power released through the "Enable" line, 0 is the minimum amount of power, and 255 is the maximum. The motor is a 12V, 300 rpm motor and can be reversed as mentioned previously. The battery consists of 4 12V rechargable lithium cells arranged in parallel.
